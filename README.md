# Priorities
Application aimed at prioritizing group activity based on value derived from items to be acquired from specified activities.

Fully developed general functionality for groups of any size receiving multiple items at once from multiple locations; looking to expand features to include:
  most important member sorting with:
    member value weighting via group importance (value gained for one member > others)
  most important item (presuming one item at a time) with:
    a list of all items from all locations in sorted order by most item value (also augmented by group value weighting)


Running `python3 group_priority.py` tests on a small section of example data.
